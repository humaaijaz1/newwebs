     <pre>       <b>Okay! So, jokes apart.
       Finally, I'm confessing this to you!</b>
       
      <I>Ever since I started talking to you, I knew I'd end up here, asking you to spend the rest of your life with me.
         I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and I don't know if it's the right time.
          To be honest, it kinda scares me. It's only been a few days, but at the same time, it kinda feels right.
        I may not be able to explain this feeling, but all I know is that I've fallen for you.
         And I'm feeling more and more each day. I can't help but feel that we have something really special!
          So first off, let's get this straight: no matter what happens in life, I will never stop loving you! 
          I may not be a perfect person, but I'll do my best to give you my all. I'll always be by your side.
          Amaan, I just love everything about you. I don't know how it happened, but I'm glad it did.
     <b> I love you Amaan and I never want to lose you!</b></I></pre>
